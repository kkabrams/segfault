 o convert aliases from a linked list to a hash-table with linked lists in
   each bucket. so O(whatever), much fast, many speed, wow.
 o fix the ugly stuff that is casted to void in returns.
 o make segfault use a hashtable for builtins too
 o delete compile.sh and stick to using Makefiles.
 o document the env vars that segfault uses
 o update seghome repo more often and reference it in segfault's repo <-- this is the reference.
 o make a way to reference env vars from aliases %${seghome}?
   OR make new %stuff to reference specific values in segfault
   since env vars aren't always set but defaults might be used.
   otherwise I'll have to set those env vars.
   //this is done using %$NAME= in a usual magic area, like aliases or lambda !say %$DERP=

--- ^^^ done ^^^ ---

 o add stuff to libirc to buffer stuff being written to the socket so that
   it can put a speed limit on that kind of stuff. (but why would the bot
   get an fd from the runit function?)
 o make the source code smaller or something.
 o port to windows eventually.
