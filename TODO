 o convert aliases from a linked list to a hash-table with linked lists in
   each bucket. so O(whatever), much fast, many speed, wow.
 o fix the ugly stuff that is casted to void in returns.

--- ^^^ done ^^^ ---

 o add stuff to libirc to buffer stuff being written to the socket so that
   it can put a speed limit on that kind of stuff. (but why would the bot
   get an fd from the runit function?)
 o make the source code smaller or something.
